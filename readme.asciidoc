When you run this application it scans through the backup files that are automatically created when you sync your iPhone with your OS X computer, extracts any recorded location information, and displays it as an animatable map. 

It *doesn't* record or share any of this information, it's purely a tool for visualizing the data on your machine. It's open source, so feel free to check the code and compile it yourself if you're concerned.

The goal is to demonstrate how much data your iPhone is collecting on your movements, and how easy it is for any program on your computer to access that information. The coordinates and time periods are deliberately shown with low accuracy to make this application less useful as a snooping tool, but the underlying data has a lot more detail.
